# MOTOR and Servo Drives 
** DRAFT work in progress **
Purpose is to create a standard interface as much as possible in MQTT 
```
dst/<device>/<motor>/rpmTarget => target RPM
src/<device>/<motor>/rpmMeasured => measured RPM
```
A device can drive different motors. 
## TRIAC Motor with Tacho from washing machine
## Stepper Motor with Magnetic angle detector
## DC Bike motor with rotation encoder
